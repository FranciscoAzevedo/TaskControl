reward is available every n seconds, availability is cued by sound but ends,
lick during reward available period leads to reward delivery

training procedure:
first is lick leads to reward cue and reward, available every n sec
- this is to reward spontaneous licks
both reward and it's cue are contingent on action

then cue availability
avail_cue predicts reward
can lick all the time but only get rew after cue
if lick is costly, patterning of the lick rate should occur
check for development of predicitve licks -> that could harm next stage
prevent this by random time intervals between rewards

suppression of predicitve licks:
make reward available only after a fixation period
assoc: time of immobility with reward, this enforces disappearnace of predicitve licks
problem: if time was learned before, then this breaks it again as reward becomes contingent on an additional action

last step
punish premature licks

result:
mouse needs to time n secs precisely to maximise rewarde rate
