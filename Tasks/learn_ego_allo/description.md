# learn to ego_allo template

instead of pushing on a manipulandom, mice reach for lateral rewards

## 1) learn to poke
random ITI -> cue on left or right side signals reward availability

criteria for progression: 
poke time distro mode <2 seconds

## 2) learn to fixate
random ITI -> light cue around init port signals trial avail
1st tone comes as soon as animal pokes in
animal can't break fixation until 2nd tone comes
fixation time increases as animals learn
random mapping of time and laterality 

criteria for progression: 
fixation time >2s
broken fixations <15%
choice times distro mode <4s

## 3) learn to time 
full ego-allo task: laterality of movement determined by init port, context and timing
start as soon as animals are able to fixate beyond interval boundary (1.5s)
first cue the correct side (implicit learning of time whilst still fully learning how to fixate)
then slowly increase probability of probe uncued timing trials

criteria for success:
sucess rate >70% (without significant differences across ports or context)
broken fixations <15%
